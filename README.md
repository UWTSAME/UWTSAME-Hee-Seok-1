  The avionics folder focuses on the Arduino nano powered telemetry computer and the accompanying python simulation
-Structures
  The structures folder focuses on the CAD designs for the rocket, including dimensions and all STL files for parts printed
-Propulsion and Recovery
  The propulsion and recovery folder focuses on the rocket motor, simulation data, and other data to find how far we go and get the data we need to recover the rocket
